## üö® ROLLBACK TRIGGER CONDITIONS

### Immediate Rollback Required (RED ALERT)
Execute **Level 1 Emergency Rollback** immediately if ANY of these occur:

#### Critical System Failures
- ‚ùå **Complete Authentication Failure** (> 90% of login attempts fail)
- ‚ùå **Database Connection Loss** (> 5 minutes of database unavailability)
- ‚ùå **Data Corruption Detected** (any evidence of cross-organization data leaks)
- ‚ùå **Security Breach** (unauthorized data access confirmed)
- ‚ùå **Application Crash Loop** (service restarts > 10 times in 5 minutes)

#### Performance Degradation (Critical Thresholds)
- ‚ùå **Response Times** > 5 seconds for critical endpoints
- ‚ùå **Error Rate** > 25% of total requests
- ‚ùå **Database Query Failures** > 50% of queries
- ‚ùå **Memory Usage** > 100MB per session (sustained)

### Conditional Rollback (YELLOW ALERT)  
Consider **Level 2 Selective Rollback** if these conditions persist > 30 minutes:

#### Performance Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Response times 500ms - 5 seconds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error rate 5% - 25%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database connection pool exhaustion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache hit rate < 50%

#### Functional Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Specific feature failures (analytics, reports)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration failures (Google OAuth, Calendar)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical authentication issues

---

## üõ†Ô∏è ROLLBACK EXECUTION LEVELS

### Level 1: Emergency Full Rollback (< 5 minutes)
**Use for critical system failures requiring immediate action**

#### Step 1.1: Immediate Kill Switch Activation (30 seconds)
```bash
# EMERGENCY: Disable RLS immediately
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_RLS_KILL_SWITCH true --scope production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_OVERRIDE_MODE true --scope production

# Trigger immediate redeployment
vercel --prod --force-new-deployment --confirm
```

#### Step 1.2: Rollback to Previous Stable Version (2 minutes)
```bash
# Get the last known working deployment
vercel deployments --scope production | head -5

# Rollback to previous version
vercel rollback --scope production --to [LAST_WORKING_DEPLOYMENT_ID]

# Verify rollback success
curl -f https://6-sense-eight.vercel.app/api/health
```

#### Step 1.3: Database Emergency Procedures (2 minutes)
```bash
# If database corruption suspected, enable emergency bypass
# Connect to Supabase dashboard
# Navigate to: SQL Editor

-- Emergency: Disable all RLS policies
ALTER TABLE contacts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE companies DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; 
ALTER TABLE meetings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Log emergency action
INSERT INTO system_logs (action, timestamp, severity) 
VALUES ('EMERGENCY_RLS_DISABLE', NOW(), 'CRITICAL');
```

### Level 2: Selective Feature Rollback (< 15 minutes)  
**Use for performance issues or specific feature failures**

#### Step 2.1: Identify Problem Components
```bash
# Check specific API endpoints
curl -w '%{time_total}' https://6-sense-eight.vercel.app/api/contacts
curl -w '%{time_total}' https://6-sense-eight.vercel.app/api/analytics
curl -w '%{time_total}' https://6-sense-eight.vercel.app/api/meetings

# Check error logs for specific issues
vercel logs --scope production | grep -E "(ERROR|CRITICAL)" | tail -50
```

#### Step 2.2: Selective Feature Disable
```bash
# Disable specific problematic features
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_ANALYTICS_DISABLED true --scope production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_REALTIME_DISABLED true --scope production  
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_AI_DISABLED true --scope production

# Keep core RLS but reduce strict mode
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_RLS_STRICT_MODE false --scope production
```

#### Step 2.3: Database Performance Rollback
```bash
# Connect to Supabase SQL Editor
-- Disable complex RLS policies temporarily
ALTER POLICY "complex_analytics_policy" ON analytics DISABLE;
ALTER POLICY "advanced_reporting_policy" ON reports DISABLE;

-- Enable simple organization filtering only
ALTER POLICY "basic_org_filter" ON contacts ENABLE;
ALTER POLICY "basic_org_filter" ON companies ENABLE;
```

### Level 3: Gradual Rollback (< 30 minutes)
**Use for systematic rollback of specific components**

#### Step 3.1: Progressive Feature Rollback
```bash
# Rollback features in order of risk
# 1. Advanced analytics
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_ADVANCED_ANALYTICS --scope production

# 2. Real-time features  
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_REALTIME_UPDATES --scope production

# 3. AI integrations
vercel env rm ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --scope production
vercel env rm ELEVENLABS_API_KEY --scope production

# 4. Complex RLS policies (keep basic organization isolation)
# Execute selective policy rollback in Supabase
```

---

## üîß DETAILED ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Application Code Rollback

#### Git-Based Rollback
```bash
# If code rollback needed
cd /path/to/sales-advisor-app

# Find last working commit
git log --oneline -10

# Rollback to specific commit
git checkout [LAST_WORKING_COMMIT_HASH]

# Force deploy previous version
vercel --prod --force-new-deployment --confirm

# Monitor deployment
vercel logs --follow --scope production
```

#### Environment Variable Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to pre-RLS environment configuration
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_RLS_ENABLED false --scope production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_USE_MOCK_AUTH true --scope production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_RLS_STRICT_MODE false --scope production

# Remove RLS-specific variables
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_RLS_KILL_SWITCH --scope production
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_OVERRIDE_MODE --scope production
```

### Database Rollback Procedures

#### RLS Policy Rollback
```sql
-- Emergency RLS policy rollback script
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Disable all RLS enforcement
ALTER TABLE contacts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE companies DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE meetings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE meeting_participants DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE actions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE action_history DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE daily_metrics DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE call_analytics DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_performance DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop problematic policies (if necessary)
-- DROP POLICY "complex_policy_name" ON table_name;

-- 3. Enable basic organization filtering only
CREATE POLICY "emergency_org_filter" ON contacts
  FOR ALL USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id'));

-- 4. Log rollback action  
INSERT INTO system_logs (
  action, 
  details, 
  timestamp, 
  severity,
  executed_by
) VALUES (
  'RLS_EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK',
  'Full RLS rollback executed due to production issues',
  NOW(),
  'CRITICAL',
  'emergency_procedure'
);
```

#### Data Integrity Verification Post-Rollback
```sql
-- Verify data integrity after rollback
-- Check for any data corruption

-- 1. Count records by organization
SELECT organization_id, COUNT(*) as contact_count 
FROM contacts 
GROUP BY organization_id 
ORDER BY organization_id;

-- 2. Check for orphaned records
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_meetings 
FROM meetings m 
LEFT JOIN contacts c ON m.contact_id = c.id 
WHERE c.id IS NULL;

-- 3. Verify user-organization relationships
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.organization_id, o.name as org_name
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN organizations o ON u.organization_id = o.id
WHERE u.organization_id IS NULL;
```
